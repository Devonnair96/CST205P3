RUNNING
-------
* Run FinalTextGame.py from IDLE
* Follow the prompts that appear on screen
* After the game is over, if you want the results of your game input your email (must be a CSUMB email address)
* Once you input your email, it will prompt you for password. This is because the email is sent to yourself.
* You will receive an email that says an outside source tried to login
* If you wish to recieve your email you must change your security settings, which can be changed back

FUTURE WORK
